        <b>public:</b> <br> <br>
        The public keyword is an access modifier used to declare that a method, variable, or class is accessible from
        any
        other class. <br> When a method or variable is declared as public, <br>
        it can be accessed by any other class in the same package or even from a different package if the class is
        imported.
        <br><br>
        <b>static:</b> <br>
        The static keyword is used to declare a method, variable, block, or nested class as belonging to the class
        rather
        than to instances of the class. <br>
        It means that the method or variable can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. <br>
        Static methods and variables are shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed using the class
        name.
        <br><br>
        <b>void:</b> <br>
        The void keyword is used to declare that a method does not return any value.
        When a method is declared with a return type of void,<br> it means the method performs some actions or tasks but
        does
        not produce any result or value. <br>
        Void methods are commonly used for performing actions such as printing to the console or updating variables
        without
        returning a value.
        <br><br>
        <b>final:</b> <br>
        The final keyword is used to declare that a variable, method, or class cannot be modified, overridden, or
        extended,
        respectively. <br>
        When applied to a variable, it means the variable's value cannot be changed once it's initialized. When applied
        to a
        method,<br>
        it means the method cannot be overridden by subclasses. When applied to a class, it means the class cannot be
        subclassed.
        <br><br>
        <b> class:</b> <br>
        The class keyword is used to declare a class in Java. A class is a blueprint for creating objects that
        encapsulate
        data and behavior. <br>
        It defines the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have. In Java,<br>
        every
        application consists of one or more classes, <br>
        and the class keyword is used to define each class. <br><br>

        <b>Write a short history of JavaScript from ECMA script 1 to ES6</b><br> <br>
        <b> ECMAScript 1 (June 1997):</b><br>
        ECMAScript, standardized as ECMA-262, was the first edition released by ECMA International. <br>
        It introduced core features such as basic syntax, control flow constructs (if, while, for), functions, and
        objects. <br><br>
        <b>ECMAScript 2 (June 1998):</b><br>
        This edition mostly focused on bug fixes and editorial changes to the specification. <br><br>

        <b>ECMAScript 3 (December 1999):</b><br>
        Considered a major update, ECMAScript 3 added features like regular expressions, try/catch exception handling,
        and <br>
        better support for structured error handling.
        It brought significant <br> improvements in performance and compatibility across different browsers. <br><br>

        <b>ECMAScript 4 (Abandoned):</b> <br>
        The proposed fourth edition underwent a lengthy development process but was ultimately abandoned due to <br>
        disagreements over its complexity and compatibility concerns. <br><br>

        <b>ECMAScript 5 (December 2009):</b> <br>
        ECMAScript 5 focused on standardizing existing implementations, bringing more features from HTML5 <br> into the
        language,
        and improving support for large-scale software development. <br>
        Introduced strict mode, JSON support, Array methods (forEach, map, filter, etc.), and more. <br><br>

        <b>ECMAScript 6 (ES6) (June 2015):</b> <br><br>
        Also known as ECMAScript 2015, ES6 was a major milestone in JavaScript's evolution. <br>
        It introduced significant language enhancements such as block-scoped variables (let and const), arrow functions,
        <br>
        classes, template literals, destructuring assignment, and modules. <br>
        ES6 aimed to make JavaScript more expressive, readable, and maintainable for developers. <br>
        Since ES6, ECMAScript has been following a yearly release cycle, introducing new features and improvements with
        each
        edition. <br> This rapid iteration has enabled JavaScript to evolve rapidly, addressing the needs of modern web
        development and beyond. <br> Subsequent versions like ES7 (2016), ES8 (2017), ES9 (2018), ES10 (2019), ES11
        (2020), ES12
        (2021), <br> and beyond continue to build upon the foundation laid by ES6, enhancing the language's capabilities
        and
        making it more powerful and versatile.
