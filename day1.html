            DIFFERENCE BTW JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT
            <br><br>
            Purpose:<br>
            Java: Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language designed for building standalone
            applications, <br>
            enterprise-level software, web servers, and Android mobile applications. It's often used for large-scale
            projects <br>
            and server-side development.<br>
            JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used for front-end web development. It's executed
            in
            web <br>
            browsers to add interactivity, dynamic content, and behavior to web pages. JavaScript is also used on the
            server-side (Node.js) <br>
            for building scalable network applications.<br>
            <br><br>
            Execution Environment:<br>
            Java: Java programs are typically compiled into bytecode, which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine
            (JVM).
            <br>
            This allows Java applications to run on any device or platform that has a compatible JVM installed.<br>
            JavaScript: JavaScript code is executed by web browsers' JavaScript engines, such as V8 in Chrome and
            SpiderMonkey in Firefox.<br>
            It's also increasingly used on the server-side with platforms like Node.js, where JavaScript code is
            executed
            outside of a browser environment.<br>
            <br><br>
            Syntax and Typing:<br>
            Java: Java is a statically-typed language, meaning variable types are explicitly declared and checked at
            compile
            time. It follows <br>
            a C-style syntax and requires strict adherence to syntax rules.<br>
            JavaScript: JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, allowing variables to hold values of any type
            without
            explicit declaration. <br>
            It follows a C-style syntax similar to Java but has more flexible and forgiving syntax rules.<br>
            <br><br>
            Concurrency:<br>
            Java: Java has built-in support for multithreading and concurrency through features like threads and
            synchronized methods.<br>
            This allows developers to create parallel and concurrent programs easily.<br>
            JavaScript: JavaScript is primarily single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one set of instructions at
            a
            time. <br>
            However, it supports asynchronous programming through features like callbacks, promises, and async/await,
            enabling <br>
            non-blocking I/O operations and concurrency.<br>
            <br><br>
            Runtime Environment:<br>
            Java: Java applications require the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) to be
            installed
            on the target <br>
            system for execution.<br>
            JavaScript: JavaScript code is executed within web browsers natively or on the server-side with environments
            like Node.js, <br>
            which provides a runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside of the browser.<br>

            <br><br><br>

            SIMILARITIES BTW JAVA AND JAVASCRIPT

            Syntax: <br>
            Both Java and JavaScript have syntax influenced by the C programming language, including curly braces {},
            semicolons ;, <br>
            and similar control structures such as loops and conditional statements.<br>
            <br><br>
            Object-Oriented Programming: <br>
            Both languages support object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms. <br>
            They allow the creation of classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. <br>
            However, Java's implementation of OOP is more strict and structured compared to JavaScript.<br>
            <br><br>
            Garbage Collection: <br>
            Both Java and JavaScript feature automatic memory management through garbage collection. <br>
            Developers don't need to manually allocate and deallocate memory, as the runtime environments handle memory
            management tasks.<br>
            <br><br>
            Community and Ecosystem: <br>
            Both languages have vibrant communities and extensive ecosystems with numerous libraries, frameworks, <br>
            and tools available for development. For Java, popular frameworks include Spring, Hibernate, and Apache
            Struts,
            <br>
            while JavaScript has frameworks like React.js, Angular, and Vue.js for front-end development, and Node.js
            for
            server-side development.<br>
            <br><br>
            Platform Independence: <br>
            While they achieve it differently, both languages offer platform independence to some extent. <br>
            Java achieves this through its bytecode and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing Java applications to
            run on
            any<br>
            platform with a compatible JVM. <br>
            JavaScript achieves platform independence through its execution in web browsers, which are available on
            various
            operating systems.<br>
            <br><br>
            Versatility: <br>
            Both Java and JavaScript are versatile languages used in a wide range of applications.<br>
            Java is used for building desktop applications, web applications, mobile applications (Android), enterprise
            software, and more.<br>
            JavaScript is primarily used for web development but can also be used for server-side development (Node.js),
            <br>
            mobile app development (React Native), desktop application development (Electron), and even IoT (Internet of
            Things) development.<br>
