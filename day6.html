            1-Purpose: <br>

            Ternary Operator: It is used to evaluate a condition and return a value based on whether the condition is true or false. It is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement that returns a value. <br>
            if-else statements: They are used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another block of code can be executed. <br>
            Switch statements: They are used to execute one block of code from multiple options based on the value of an expression. <br><br>
           
            2-Syntax: <br>

            Ternary Operator: (condition) ? expression1 : expression2 <br>
            if-else statements: <br>
            Switch statements: <br><br>

            3-Usage: <br>

            Ternary Operator: It is commonly used for assigning values to variables or returning values from functions based on a condition. <br>
            if-else statements: They are used when you have to evaluate multiple conditions or when the condition is more complex. <br>
            Switch statements: They are used when there are multiple cases to be <br>
            evaluated against a single expression. Switch statements are particularly useful when dealing with enum types or when there are many possible values to check against. <br> <br>
            
            4-Number of Conditions: <br>

            Ternary Operator: It evaluates only one condition. <br>
            if-else statements: They can handle multiple conditions by using else-if clauses. <br>
            Switch statements: They can handle multiple conditions, but each case must evaluate to a constant value. <br> <br>
            
            5-Execution Flow: <br>

            Ternary Operator: It returns one of two values based on the result of a condition. <br>
            if-else statements: They allow for more complex branching of code execution based on various conditions. <br>
            Switch statements: They provide a way to select from multiple options based on the value of an expression. <br> <br>
           
            6-Readability: <br>

            Ternary Operator: It can sometimes make code harder to read, especially for complex conditions. <br>
            if-else statements: They are more readable, especially for longer conditions and multiple branches of code. <br>
            Switch statements: They can be more readable when there are many options to choose from, but they may become complex if there are too many cases.
