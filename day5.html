    DIFFERENCIATE BTW COMPARISONS AND LOGICAL OPEREATORS <br>
    Comparison Operators:

    Comparison operators are symbols used to compare two values or expressions. They evaluate to a Boolean value <br>
    (true or false) depending on the relationship between the operands. Common comparison operators include: <br>

    1-Equal to (==): Checks if two values are equal. <br>
    2-Not equal to (!=): Checks if two values are not equal. <br>
    3-Greater than (>): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.<br>
    4-Less than (<): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.<br>
    5-Greater than or equal to (>=): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.<br>
    6-Less than or equal to (<=): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.<br>
    7-Example (Python):

    python<br>
    Copy code<br>
    x = 5<br>
    y = 10<br>

    print(x == y) # False<br>
    print(x < y) # True<br>
    print(x >= y) # False<br>
    
    Logical Comparison:

Logical comparisons involve using logical operators to combine multiple comparison expressions. <br>
 These operators include: <br>

1-AND (and): Returns true if both operands are true. <br>
2-OR (or): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true. <br>
3-NOT (not): Returns the opposite of the operand's Boolean value. <br>
Example (Python):

python<br>
Copy code<br>
x = 5<br>
y = 10<br>
z = 3<br>

# Logical AND <br>
print(x < y and y < z)  # False <br>

# Logical OR <br>
print(x < y or y < z)   # True <br>

# Logical NOT <br>
print(not (x < y))      # False<br>
In summary, comparison operators are used to compare individual values or expressions, <br>
while logical comparisons involve combining multiple comparison expressions to form more complex conditions.
